The story of a 'wise' man and how to become 'wiser'
Becoming 'wiser'


About 30000 years ago Homo Sapienes started to dominate all the other life forms.
Presumably we even whiped out our close ancesters - Neanderthals. 
Fun fact, 'Sapiens' comes from latin and means 'wiser'.

the Cognitive Revolution (70,000 years ago), the Agricultural Revolution (10,000 years ago), and the Scientific Revolution (500 years ago

The reason to such a crazy development humans expirienced, was due to our exrtraordinary communcation abilities.
On evolutionary level we have invested a lot into that part of our brain. Monkeys for example are lacking such an advanced 
communication skills, but instead they have an extraordinary short term memory. Here is a fun video of monkey memorizing the position
of all the numbers in an instant.
