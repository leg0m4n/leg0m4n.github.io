title: Congratualtions, you are human! 
---

Hi, human being. 10s of thousands of years ago, your great ancestors invented speech. A few thousand years ago, your other ancestors invented writing. This is the only reason why me and you, can communicate through this text right now. Although this communication is one sided, I still find it to be a miracle. I am writing this text on April 10th, 2022, you are reading it sometime in the future. If there's one thing we can say about humanity and why we are the most successful species, is that we are great at communicating. This is our superpower.

When 50-70 thousands of years ago during evolution monkeys chose really good short term memory, we instead chose speech. Both on physiological level -- design of our speech aparatus, and on cognitive level , we were striving to become better at communicating. Here is a fun video of monkey memorizing the position of all the numbers in an instant, what no human can do:

Fun trick, monkey, but speech is cooler!

If we look closer at the history of humans, we can see that progress was happening the most when there was a new breakthrough in communications. Speech, Writing, Printing Press, Mass production of books, telegraph, phone, internet. Today, anyone and any information in the world is at the tips of your fingers. Now, what? Where else can we go from here? At first sight, it seems like all communication problems have been solved. Success.

The best way to see, what could be the next big thing, is to zoom out, to see how things are on a greater scale(that’s where the “build things that don’t scale” by PG comes from). Take for example messengers, a great achievement of the last communication leap, they work great, you may call anyone in the world, right? You pick a messenger, you call your friend in China, and what do you hear first? “嗨你過的怎麼樣？” How’s your communication thingy going? 

How do you see the language barrier problem in the world? Maybe some may say that eventually everyone will just learn English. Fair idea. But, how many generations should pass to teach the whole planet English? Too many, in my humble opinion. Not even taking into account the importance of preserving the culture.

The solution that we are working on at Blanc, is to use AI to translate all domains of information(video, audio, text — all real time eventually) into all languages. Universal AI translation engine.  Automatically and at a scale. 

We are starting with video, because of how important it became in our lives. Across all information domains, this is the most valuable. The most profitable companies are video companies: Netflix, Youtube, Zoom, TikTok, Vimeo, etc. This is the perfect adoption point. A service to globalize all video/audio platforms. Think of it as a very advanced YouTube subtitles button in any video player on any platform, that just makes people speak any language.

This is what we can do right now in a semi automatic mode — proof read by native speaker at the end of our ML pipeline(full automatic mode is coming out in 6 month, will write another post about it):

This is how the Earth looks right now from your perspective, dear reader:

This is how it can look in 5 years:

If you want to reach more people across the world, but 150$/minute from conventional dubbing studios is too much, we would be happy to help at useblanc.com
We also have API for semi-auto video, auto audio, auto text translations in private beta, for platforms/messengers/bots, if you'd like to expand globaly, write to me directly in twitter or email below.
