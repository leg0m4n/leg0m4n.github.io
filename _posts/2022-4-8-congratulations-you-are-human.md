title: Congratualtions, you are human!

Hi, human being. Around 50 - 70 millennia ago, your great ancestors invented speech. Around 5 millennia ago, your other ancestors invented writing. This is the only reason why me and you, can communicate through this text right now. Although this communication is one sided, I still find it to be a miracle. I am writing this text on April 10th, 2022, you are reading it sometime in the future. If there's one thing we can say about humanity and why we are so successful as a species, is that we are great at communicating. This is our superpower.

When during evolution monkeys chose really good short term memory, we instead were betting on speech. Both on physiological and cognitive levels, we were striving to become better at communicating. This is how we won. Here is a fun video of a monkey memorizing the position of all the numbers in an instant, what no human can do:

Fun trick, monkey, but speech is cooler!

If we look closer at the history of humans, we can see that progress was happening the most when there was a new breakthrough in communications. Speech, Writing, Printing Press, Mass production of books, Telegraph, Phone, Internet. Today, anyone and any information in the world is at the tips of your fingers. Now, what? Where else can we go from here? At first sight, it seems like all communication problems have been solved. Success.

The best way to see, what's next is to zoom out, to see how things are on a greater scale. I think this is where “build things that don’t scale” by PG, actually comes from. Things don't scale until they do. Take for example messengers, a great achievement of the last communication leap, they work great, you can call anyone in the world, right? You pick a messenger, you call your friend in China, and what do you hear first? “嗨你過的怎麼樣?” How’s your communication thingy going? There are at max 20% of people on Earth who you can understand. The truth is we are still just a bunch of tribes.

Maybe some of you may say that eventually everyone will just learn English. Fair idea. But, how many generations should pass to teach the whole planet English? Too many, in my humble opinion. Not even taking into account the importance of preserving the culture. Last time, someone \* khm \* Britain tried to teach someone English, it didn't end well. 

The solution that we are working on at [Blanc](https://useblanc.com), is to use AI to translate all types of information(video, audio, text — all in real-time eventually) into all languages. Universal AI translation engine. What will happen when billions of people have access to high quality translations? Imagine the amount of unrealised potential it will unlock, both on economical and social levels. Tapping into a global market will be just the same as into local. Global awareness about who we are and how we live will help transition all countries into democracies and for those contrarian of you, saying that it's flawed, of course it's flawed, like any system, but it's the best we have).

This is what we can do right now in a semi automatic mode — proof read by native speaker at the end of our ML pipeline(full automatic mode is coming out in 6 month, will write another post about it):
It's a video of Lex Fridman talking in Mandarin, Spanish, Russian(choose in a dropdown menu):
