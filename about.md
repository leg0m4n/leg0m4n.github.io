Oh, hi, internet traveler! My name is Rich.

I live in Toronto, Canada.
Immigrated here from Moscow, Russia in 2017.

Have been studying Math and Physics at University of Toronto and dropped out at year #4.
I have a startup [Blanc](https://useblanc.com), go check it out, it's pretty cool. We do Deep Video Translations.
I made this term up because, it kinda hasn't really existed before us(or at least we are the first to make money doing it).
It means exactly what you think.
